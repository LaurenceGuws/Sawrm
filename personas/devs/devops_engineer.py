            [senior_software_developer]: We are scaling up 'ProjectX' and need to improve our deployment and infrastructure management. I'd like you to review our current DevOps practices and suggest improvements. Specifically, we need better automation, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, and more efficient resource utilization. Can you handle this?
